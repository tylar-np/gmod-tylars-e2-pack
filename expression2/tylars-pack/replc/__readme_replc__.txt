    RepLC... like OLC, but on steroids.
    
    "Rep" refers to "replica". It's a tongue-in-cheek way of describing the chip as a "replica" train power chip,
    kinda like a replica watch. It's meant to be a little bit of an easy upgrade from OLC, but there are a bunch
    more features to make it look and/or feel like a more complicated... or sophisticated... chip:
        - Highly user-configurable
        - Builtin downforce: optional with configurable thresholding and buildup based on speed
        - Can be parented or welded: if parented, you can select the entity to apply force to
        - OLC-style throttle with an optional reverser: 0-100%, reverser has standard back, neutral/centered, forward positions
            - The reverser is off and the throttle will work exactly like OLC if you turn fake notch sounds off (see next line)
        - Can fake notch & transition sounds based on throttle setting: optional; this is compatible with PT/PT2 sound sets
        - Startup/shutdown sequence: optional immersion
        - 2-speed throttle adjustment for precision speeding: configure throttle adjustment speeds with or without a held key
        - "Safety" switch option: you can wire this to make sure you don't hit a control by accident
        - Example bonecore + bodygroup control stand included for GP7/GP9/GP16/GP20
        - Highly optimized to run using as little CPU time as needed
        - Offset engine sound position and additional DSP for distant engine sound (requires XtraSound)
    
    Version 0.0.5 ALPHA - Contains all the features listed above. Can generally be used.
    Next version - expect a sort of MU system for linking chips together in a consist.
